This Notebook is a project on methods can help to do Bayesian inference. Sometimes Bayesian formula does not have analytical solution or it does but it was computationally expensive to find the answer, someone needs to find another way to infer the result. In such cases, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can help.
